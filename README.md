## About Me:
Currently, I'm doing Master's of Science in Data Analytics at Queen Marry, University of London, UK. In this
programme, I will gain a solid understanding of the underlying theoretical concepts from probability theory and
statistics, learn how to manipulate and visualise data using tools such as R and Excel, and gain hands-on
experience of using machine-learning algorithms to extract value from large data sets. They will also teach me
how to program in Python, the industry-standard computer language for data analysis.

My bachelor's degree is in Computer Information Systems from Crimson College of Technology. The four-year
Bachelor of Computer Information Systems program of Pokhara University integrates information technology with
business management - an integration that best responds to the emerging needs of the modern business. During
my undergraduate program, I have studied Data Structures and Algorithms, Data Analysis and Modeling, Statistics
where I got to know concepts such as multivariable calculus, statistics and probability theory, which were the
beginning of my interest and played a vital role for pursuing my career.

I look forward to seek internship opportunities in following fields:
  â€¢ Analytics (Business/IT/Data/Marketing/Digital Media)
  â€¢ Business Intelligence, Big Data
  â€¢ Data Engineering
